            <h1 id="mission">Mission-2023</h1>
            <p>Poor, inadequate or no education leads to calamitous consequences, appearing in the form of violence, climate disasters, poverty, inequalities, discrimination and threats to global peace. In turn, these consequences are threatening education itself. Reform is not enough. A transformation is needed, and that must begin with education.</p>
